This will not invalidate your conda installation, but possibly your pre-existing conda envs will be in a different location (e.g. ``/Users/USER_NAME/opt/anaconda3/envs/``) then the new mamba envs (e.g. ``/Users/USER_NAME/mambaforge/envs/``). You can verify this by running ``conda env list``. The addition of ``export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=/Users/user/opt/anaconda3/envs/`` into your ``.bashprofile`` or ``.zprofile`` file will fix this. \n",
